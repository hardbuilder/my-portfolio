The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that contains the icon image for the website. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

If you have a specific image you want to use as a favicon, you can convert it to the `.ico` format using online tools or image editing software. Once you have the `.ico` file, place it in the `public` directory of your project.

If you need further assistance with creating or converting an image to a favicon, please let me know!
